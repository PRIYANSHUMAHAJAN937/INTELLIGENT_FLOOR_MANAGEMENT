# INTELLIGENT_FLOOR_PLAN_MANAGEMENT

The Floor Plan Management System is a robust solution designed for efficiently managing floor plans, particularly for meeting rooms and their respective capacities. It offers a sophisticated admin panel for seamless modification of floor plans, along with advanced features such as conflict resolution, version control, and robust authentication mechanisms.

The system utilizes a powerful tech stack including Java, Spring Boot, and the H2 Database for optimal performance and scalability. It incorporates object-oriented programming principles like abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism, ensuring flexibility, adaptability, and easy maintenance.

Despite being developed in a short timeframe, the system makes trade-offs such as opting for a CLI-style UI and choosing a simpler database solution over more advanced options. It also prioritizes fault tolerance and database consistency in handling system failures.
